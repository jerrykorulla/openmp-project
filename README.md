# Sample OpenMP C++ Project

This is a sample C++ project that demonstrates the use of OpenMP for parallel programming, along with CMake for building the application.


## Project Structure

```
my_openmp_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── .gitignore
└── src/
    └── main.cpp
```


## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have CMake and a compiler with OpenMP support (e.g., GCC or Clang) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my_openmp_project
   ```
3. Create a build directory:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build .
   ```


## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application with the following command:

```
./my_openmp_project
```

## OpenMP Usage

This project demonstrates basic usage of OpenMP for parallelizing C++ code. You can find OpenMP constructs (such as `#pragma omp parallel for`) in the source files, especially in `main.cpp` and `core.cpp`. To experiment with different parallelization strategies, modify or extend these files.

If you want to change the number of threads, you can set the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before running the application:

```
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
./my_openmp_project
```
